# Fire Image Proxy

Fire Image Proxy is a WordPress plugin designed to streamline your local development process. It works by swapping the URLs of your images, making it easier to work with your local setup.

## Features

- **URL Swapping**: Fire Image Proxy can replace the URLs of your images, pointing them to your local setup instead of the live site. This is particularly useful when you're working offline or when you want to reduce the load on your live server.

- **Selective Downloading**: Instead of downloading all images from your live site, Fire Image Proxy allows you to download only the images you need for your local development. This can significantly speed up your setup process and save disk space.

## How to Use

1. Install & Activate the plugin in your WordPress setup.
2. Navigate to the Fire Image Proxy settings page under Tools.
3. Specify the URL of your live site and the URL of your local site.
4. Toggle load remote images to on. The plugin and it will start swapping the URLs of your images.
5. Enable Image Downloads and the plugin will start downloading the remote images to your local setup. On the next page load it will use your local images that have been downloaded instead of the remote url.
